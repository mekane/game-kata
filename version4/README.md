# Version 4

This version extends the previous version in order to make the module
that saves and loads game testable. The basic building blocks are in
place but the code hasn't been wired up yet, so that you can practice
writing the tests.

Tasks:

 * Add tests for the gamePersistence module to make sure it correctly
   makes use of the data store it is given. (A spy is appropriate here)
 * Add tests for the inMemoryStore to make sure it works as expected
 *
